Amplitude-Phase Interaction Network with Gated Fusion for Speech Emotion Recognition

The method is trained and tested using Python 3.7 and Keras 2.9. The PC running Ubuntu 14.04 with 128GB RAM and an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 Ti GPU is used for the trials. Lastly, the GPU's training speed is increased by using Nvidia CUDA 11.0.

The dynamic relative pahse (DRP) features are extracted by Matlab.
